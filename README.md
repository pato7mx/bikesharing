# Module 14 Challenge bikesharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis

I used a data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. I created worksheets, dashboards, and a storie in Tableau to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset and use key findings from that analysis to weigh the viability of taking the bikeshare business model to Des Moines.

## Results

Link to the story created in Tableau: [NYC CitiBike Story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/NF4BSX6R4?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Looking at the story presented in Tableau you can find the following:
Pages of the story:
1. An overview of the data, including total number of rides and what are the peak hours of usage.
2. We can see a trip furation graph and conclude trips are always less than 60 minutes, so bikes are being used for commuting rather than sightseeing around the city
3. We can see the trip duration graph again but brokedown by gender. We can see males take much more trips but the duration of them is fairly semilar to women
4. We can observe a heat map that describes the start time for trips brokedown by weekday and hour. It is clear that there are more trips in the commuting hours during the weekdays (7-9 AM and 5-6 PM) and on weekends we don't have a clear pattern as people usually don't go to work
5. We can see the same heatmap as in point 4 but broke down by gender. Again the only difference is that women take less trips but have a similiar behavior than men.
6. Finally we can see an overview of the type of customer brokedown by weekday and gender. Where again we can see men are using the service a lot.


## Summary

The bike sharing program is more popular with male users, but there are still a considerable amount of females, that have a similiar behavior, just take less trips. Maybe we could analyze why females are using the service less and try to market it towards a femala audience in Des Moines. The number of subscribers is good when we look at the ratio with the customers, this means that users are using the service constantly rather than only one time. Also the people use the bikes to move predominantly throught the center of the city and looking at the peak hours of usage we can see that it is probably being used to commute, so we could market it as a great alternative to cars and public tarnsportation in des moines.
